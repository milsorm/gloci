- allow bulk operations in wires definition
- bulk operation var<0:f> = @var<0:f> ... will provide var0 = @var0, var1 = @var1 ...
- bulk operation like var<0:f> = zero or var<0:f> = other<0:3> (var4 = other0 again...)

- Gloci::Circuits for list of circuits (specialization)
- Gloci::Loci::BuiltinFactory as factory for builtins

- allow set input wires through command line or permute unset wires

- implementation:
  - load everything
  - check correctness
  - implement execution for file based
  - implement execution for bultins
  - set up signal to wires from command line
  - permute unset wires

- led as led panel (16 diods) + address
- display as another port command for instructing character set (ascii, 80x25)

- can be converted to bytecode (fixed length information) and processed in C program (in case memory, speed)

- steps:
  - static circuits
  - memories (dynamic circuits)
  - sequence reading
  - conditions on byte
  - iterator + memory access
  - eprom building from file
  - computers
