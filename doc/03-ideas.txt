- move to App::Gloci from Gloci:: ?
- prepare as dzil package for easy deployment ?

- implementation:
  - check correctness
  - implement execution for file based
  - implement execution for bultins
  - set up signal to wires from command line
  - permute unset wires

- led as led panel (16 diods) + address
- display as another port command for instructing character set (ascii, 80x25)

- can be converted to bytecode (fixed length information) and processed in C program (in case memory, speed)

- steps:
  - static circuits
      displaying 4-bytes and 8-bytes on LED panel
      add2, add4, add8, add16, add32
      multiplicators
      implementation of negative numbers (two's complement code)
      subtract, divide
      comparers
      multiply-adders
      num2bin, bin2num & display
  - memories (dynamic circuits)
  - sequence reading
  - conditions on byte
  - iterator + memory access
  - eprom building from file
  - computers
